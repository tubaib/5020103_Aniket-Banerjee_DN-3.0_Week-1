Step 1: Understand Recursive Algorithms
Concept of Recursion:

Definition: Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. A function that calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursive.
Base Case: The simplest case of the problem which can be solved without further recursion.
Recursive Case: The case where the function calls itself with a smaller or simpler subset of the problem.
Benefits: Simplifies code and can solve complex problems more intuitively, especially when the problem has a repetitive structure or natural hierarchy.

Step 3: Implementation
Recursive Algorithm Implementation:

Here is the Java implementation for a recursive algorithm to predict future values:
public class FinancialForecasting {

   
    public static double calculateFutureValue(double initialValue, double growthRate, int years) {
        
        if (years == 0) {
            return initialValue;
        }
        
        return calculateFutureValue(initialValue, growthRate, years - 1) * (1 + growthRate);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double initialValue = 1000.0;
        double growthRate = 0.05; 
        int years = 10;
        double futureValue = calculateFutureValue(initialValue, growthRate, years);
        System.out.printf("Future value after %d years: %.2f%n", years, futureValue);
    }
}

Step 4: Analysis
Time Complexity of the Recursive Algorithm:

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of years. Each recursive call performs a constant amount of work and the recursion depth is n, leading to linear time complexity.
Space Complexity: O(n) due to the function call stack, which grows with the depth of recursion.
Optimizing the Recursive Solution:

Memoization: To avoid redundant calculations, use a cache to store results of already computed values. This is particularly useful when dealing with overlapping subproblems.
Iterative Approach: For problems where recursion depth could be very large, an iterative approach may be used to reduce space complexity by avoiding the recursion stack.

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class FinancialForecastingOptimized {

    private static Map<Integer, Double> memo = new HashMap<>();

    
    public static double calculateFutureValue(double initialValue, double growthRate, int years) {
       
        if (years == 0) {
            return initialValue;
        }
        // Check if the result is already computed
        if (memo.containsKey(years)) {
            return memo.get(years);
        }
       
        double futureValue = calculateFutureValue(initialValue, growthRate, years - 1) * (1 + growthRate);
        memo.put(years, futureValue);
        return futureValue;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double initialValue = 1000.0; 
        double growthRate = 0.05; 
        int years = 10; 

        double futureValue = calculateFutureValue(initialValue, growthRate, years);
        System.out.printf("Future value after %d years: %.2f%n", years, futureValue);
    }
}
